Computing the denominator of this formulation involves performing a full softmax over the entire vocabulary words, which are often large (105-107) terms.

The noise contrastive estimation (NCE) loss function is an efficient approximation for a full softmax. With an objective to learn word embeddings instead of modeling the word distribution, the NCE loss can be simplified to use negative sampling.

The simplified negative sampling objective for a target word is to distinguish the context word from num_ns negative samples drawn from noise distribution Pn(w) of words. More precisely, an efficient approximation of full softmax over the vocabulary is, for a skip-gram pair, to pose the loss for a target word as a classification problem between the context word and num_ns negative samples.
